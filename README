What is Giada?
--------------
	Giada is a free, minimal, hardcore audio tool for djs and live 
	performers. Load or record up to 32 samples, choose to play them in 
	single mode (drum machine) or loop mode (sequencer) and start the show 
	with your computer keyboard as a controller. Giada aims to be a 
	compact and portable virtual device for Linux, Windows and OS X for 
	production use and live sets.
