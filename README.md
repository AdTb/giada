What is Giada?
--------------
Giada is a free, minimal, hardcore audio tool for DJs and live
performers. How does it work? Just pick up your sample, drop it in any
channel and start the show by using this tiny piece of software as a
loop machine, drum machine, sequencer, live sampler or yet as an effect
(VST) host. Giada aims to be a compact and portable virtual device for
Linux, Mac OS X and Windows for production use and live sets.
